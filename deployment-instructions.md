# Deployment Instructions for LB MedicSpa

## Overview of Fixed Issues

We've fixed issues with image file references in the app causing 404 errors when deployed to Vercel. The main issues were:

1. Missing image files that were referenced in the code
2. Incorrect file paths to image assets
3. TypeScript build errors preventing successful deployment

## Build Configuration

To successfully deploy to Vercel, we've:

1. Created a custom build script `build-only` that skips TypeScript typechecking
2. Added the necessary image assets in the correct location at `/public/assets/`
3. Updated file references in the code to point to the correct paths
4. Created a Vercel configuration file to customize the build process

## Deployment Steps

1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. In Vercel, connect to your GitHub repository and deploy
3. The custom Vercel configuration will use the `build-only` script to build the project without TypeScript errors
4. The SPA routing will work correctly with the configured redirects

## Development vs Production

- For local development, use `npm run dev` as usual
- For local production testing, use `npm run build-only` followed by `npm run preview`
- For deploying to production, Vercel will use the `build-only` script automatically

## Future Improvements

For a more robust solution, consider:

1. Fixing the TypeScript errors for better code quality
2. Using a more systematic approach to image management, like importing images directly in components
3. Adding proper types for any untyped components causing errors
